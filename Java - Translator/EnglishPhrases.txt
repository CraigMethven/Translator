Come again
How's that again

That was very good
I want one

What was it like
How did it go
What don't you have
This is what I like about her
She wants him
I can't deal with this right now
I'm here
Was it good
Are you still up
As you treat me, so I will treat you
What goes around comes around
I like him
I have something for you
How did you find me
I want you

I don't know that
I don't know
This one's on me

I don't go in for that sort of thing
I mean it
It was not always this way
I don't know that
I don't know
I dinnae ken
I've got nothing
I don't have anything
He doesn't like us
He does not like us
Are you still here
I want this
I have a book
I'm not feeling well
I'm not very well
I don't love you
You're what
She doesn't know yet
Is there anything wrong with you
I like her very much
They're not always there
I don't want it anymore
I don't want that anymore
I no longer want that
This isn't about you
What do you have
Does he like me
I love you
I love her
I don't know yet
I still don't know that
I didn't hear it
I dislike them all
I'm fed up
There are too many of them
And you, how are you
What do you have
What's the matter with him
I don't like you anymore
I was not feeling well
I didn't want it

Are these yours
He has a book
She does not do things like that
She was not feeling well
It's none of your business
That is no business of yours
It is none of your business
None of your business
That's none of your business
What is she up to
Is she all right
She's all right
Do we have one
I want you here
He does not know
That's how it's always been
I love you very much
I love you a lot
It can't be
This can't be
This is what I like about him
How does she do this
I have no idea
I don't know
I don't know
I dinnae ken
They aren't here yet
They haven't arrived yet
Can this be it
How is it going

I want a book
Do we have one
I don't need it
I don't need that
Are you from here
This matter does not concern me
He doesn't know yet
How's the world treating you
Are you all right
Are you OK
I don't love her anymore
I don't mean you
I don't need it
What does it concern you
What does that have to do with you
The door wasn't closed
I want it now
This is what I like about you
I don't want anything
It's none of your business
It's none of your business
That is no business of yours
That has nothing to do with you
It is none of your business
This has nothing to do with you
None of your business

That doesn't concern you
This doesn't involve you
This is all on me
And you, how are you
I really like you
I love you
I love you
We are here
She knows what she wants
I heard it
I have a house
I have a home
I like all of them
That is no business of his
She's looking at you
He came to see me
I don't want that anymore
I no longer want that
I have a dog
I have a car
It doesn't belong to you
Don't you want to come along
I love him
I don't know how
I am a man
I'm a man
I've got more
Did you hear that
I don't love you anymore
Did you hear it
I don't know where they are
He is not of our number
He doesn't belong to us
He's not in our group
He's not one of us
Does she exist
I'm not like Mary
It did not end well
It doesn't matter so much
I don't know her
I don't know them
I do not love him any longer
I no longer love him
I do not love him anymore
That's the way she likes it
Do you have a car
Have you got a car
Did you hear that
I'm not your father
I am not your father
I know what I want
She's looking at me
What does he mean to do
What does he intend to do
What does he plan to do
He gave it to me
This isn't yours
I really like her
You can have it
I want it now
We're from here
Did you hear it
What is he doing with her
I don't know much about you
What a man you are
You're too old for me
Will you go with us
Here you are
You are really very good
He was not feeling well
I wanted this
I heard you
I know only this
It's always been that way
Do you have a dog
Have you got a dog
Do you have a car
Have you got a car
I am in the house
Are you still there
Nor am I
Me neither
What does she do
This is what I like about you
I am in the house
I'm in the house
I don't know any more than you do
He has a dog
Does he have a dog
He has a car
Not now
You have everything
Do you have everything
And here they are
I'm in the car
I want to be like her
I'll have something for you soon
We're not there yet
She's looking at you
He didn't show up
Don't come
You can have this
He has one too
She went with him
I'll come to your place
She wants more
What does he want
I don't have this book
She likes all of us
He is doing well
He's all right
She was looking at you
I don't act like you
How are you now
That's the way I like it
Is he all right
He's doing well
You have everything
Do you have everything
I love you more than her
Never mind
It doesn't matter
What can't you do
She was looking at him
She gave it to him
Do I exist
How are you today
You are what you eat
He has one too
I don't need this anymore
You can have this
How's the world treating you
You are really very good
I've heard of you
I need you
I already know
Have you got the money
Thus I have heard
Nowadays, this is not like this anymore
Don't you have any money
Do you have some money
I'm as old as you
I don't know you
That's mine
That belongs to me
He wants to be like me
I don't like him either
The door won't open
How can it be
How can that be
She's looking at us
I'm still in love with you
I still love you
We're still here
He is unable to do it
I want more
I do like you
We can't do that
We can't do it
We cannot do that
I want your love
It's all going to be OK
She gives it to him
I don't have much money
I gave you a book
I don't have a car
Have you got the money
How are you
I'm with you
That's hers
He was looking at her
Where are you
What's your location
Where are they
She looks very good
I don't know him
I am not acquainted with him
I don't see it
Are you still there
I still love him
She has no idea what she’s doing
I need you here
I am like my father
What are you guys doing
It was really good
Do that for me
She knows what’s going on
I've never heard of her
It's none of your business
That is no business of yours
It is none of your business
None of your business
That's none of your business
I know her very well
I really like him
Are you OK
I'm fine too
I can't get along with him
I don't know everything
That's how it should be
I cannot see it
I can't see it
What does this look like to you
It may be
I feel perfectly fine
I know it very well
I remember it as if it were yesterday
I love you more than him
I don't hate you
You are my father
They are very old
It's not unheard of
You may take the book
What are your plans for today
What ever can that be
I don't have time for you
How did it end
He gave her a book
Come along with us
Where am I
They don't have a car
What is he up to now
What is going on here
I want to be like him
He's looking at me
What does she see
I was going out
What will become of me
You're a man now
Now, I like it too
I've heard nothing
I didn't hear anything
Does she have money
She doesn't love me anymore
What are your plans for today
Was that you in the car
What will become of her
I know myself very well
I am having a look at it
She knows she's looking fine
From nothing comes nothing
You are a woman
I am your father
I'm your father
Don't stand up
Is that yours
I never heard anything like that
He knows what he wants
It doesn't belong to you
Did you hear something
I want much more
The clock does not run
The watch doesn't work
I don't have any more money
I'm often here
I don't want to be here
You may take the book
I don't like this
I don't like that
That isn't to my liking
I don't like it
I do not have any money
I have no money
I don't have any money
I don't have money
I don't have any money
I don't want to see you
Don't look at her
Don't look at me like that
It's still mine
I'm not your friend
I'm no friend of yours
I'm not good at this sort of thing
He's looking at you
I can't see you
She gave him a book
She handed him a book
I don't know anything
I can't see well
I don't hate myself
He was looking at you
Were they here
I don't have a dog
I like my house
I'm doing this for you
She doesn't like it here
I need you here
I don't know anything
I don't see him
I am a woman
I'm a woman
I'm a woman
What does she look like
I need you
He is talking to her
I wasn't born yesterday
I was not born yesterday
You are what you eat
They are what you eat
I know him very well
I have some money
I'm a cat
I am a cat
What did she look like
Where are you
Where art thou
What's your location
You don't need that
I want that one
That's how he likes it
He knows what’s going on
She did not come until two
Please don't get up
She has a lot of money
What does it look like
How does it look
I know them
I know her
I gave him a book
I want a lot
What is he doing
He looks very good
I gave him the book
I don't hate you
Don't you have any money
They have no money
You want this
Things are looking good
This looks good
It looks good
That looks good
I don't have a house anymore
Don't look at me
How are you now
What did she want
I'll come with you
You don't know them
Did you hear it too
Everything went well with him
They're almost here
How are you
I know her well
I don't have a car anymore
Don't eat too much
She still loves him
That looks smart on you
This book belongs to me
This book is mine
I have some food
I saw nothing
Do you want it
He gave in
It belongs to me now
I only need you
I don't hate him
You haven't any money
Don't you have any money
This must be my book
That must be my book
Did you hear it too
I've heard of you
Are you all right
Are you OK
You're a woman
You are a woman
I love you
I've never heard of him
I don't want to see you
That isn't to my liking
He has no money
You are much too kind to me
I have money
Everything's going to be fine
It's all going to be OK
I love you, too
Come along
Come with me
What do you want from me
She relented
I am not coming today
I am not coming today
I don't hate you anymore
She knows what she's doing
You have him there
Do you do that often
Here we are
Here we are
We've arrived
Don't look at him
Eat this up
I like it very much
Look at this
There's nothing here
Is she coming, too
I don't know where
He still loves her
How old are you
He doesn't love me anymore
I need it today
I saw it, too
He was very old
That is the most I can do
She didn't have much money
What do you see in her
I get on well with him
I have nothing to eat
Do you have a wife
There you are
Don't ask me for money
You aren't alone
What're you doing today
What are you doing today
You have him there
I have a lot of money
I like your car
Pardon me
Excuse me
I don't know who you are
He shall have it
I know what you mean
I hear you
I hear what you're saying
Do you have anything to eat
I don't feel so good
I do not have much time
I don't have much time
I’ve got no money left
Are you still here
She likes him
She loves him
She doesn't listen to me
It doesn't belong to you
I do not have a cat
I don't have a cat
I don't have a cat
What're you good at
What was he up to
No more today
I have no money today
He gave him a book
He can do what he wants
He said that he didn't know
I've heard everything
I heard everything
Can I eat this
How old am I
I don't do it anymore
I do nothing of the kind
You're not feeling well, are you
Mary, I love you
Don't come again
He isn't coming, either
She has no fear
I saw a dog
I saw a dog
You cannot do this
You can't do this
You can't do that
She still loves him
She still loves him
She still loves him
How much money do you have
I know that she knows
Is Mary well
Do they have money
Do you love me
I have no money with me
They have nothing to eat
I'm not speaking to her
I want him to leave
She was kind to me
There's nowt as queer as folk
Can I see that
Is there any room for me
I've often heard about you
I want Mary
Will you go, too
You are not my brother
I ran out of money
I answered the door
I'm as tall as you
I don't know you
I'm not eating this
I know nothing about him
I do not know anything about him
I don't know anything about him
Everything's going to be OK
He had a dog
What subject are you poor at
Let's open it
Can I see it
He doesn't know who I am
How many people are here today
I'm not your boyfriend
How are you now
She gave him the car
I don't hate you anymore
I know a lot about you
She appears well today
How much money does he have
They're alive
I know how to do it
I know you
I'm old
He doesn't want to see you
I don't want to eat here
You're a good father
Is the cat all right
Do you have any money
Do you have money
I am there
What wasn't easy
I am well acquainted with him
You're a woman now
You cannot do this
I can't go
I can't walk
You eat more food than I do
I like my life
What does he look like
Mary likes you
What does he see
He loves her
You must do it this way
That won't work
That's the way she likes it
Does he have money
He has money
Where are we
I am not liked by this dog
I've heard of you
What is the cat up to
Would you like for me to do that for you
How old are you
What do you see in her
I want a lot more
Without you, I am nothing
I am nothing without you
I don't feel well
I'm not feeling well
I know what you want
I'll do that
He has a lot of money
He's looking good
He looks nice
I know him
Do I know him
I ken him
I am seeing it
How many of you are there
Does she have a boyfriend
You aren't alone
I love my home
He doesn't know me
That's his
How are things
I'm going to go
You're a good man
You are a good man
You're what
Nothing comes from nothing
Nothing can come of nothing
Nothing can be produced out of nothing
No pain, no gain
They were fine
Yes, I like it very much
He has a hat on
But how can they do this
This door won't open
I'm not afraid
I am not afraid
I can do this alone
Open the door
What're you doing here
He also saw it
She said this
He didn't see anything
I want to live forever
I do feel pretty good
He came just as I was leaving
Are you as tall as me
I want to be here
Is this yours
The dog is mine
He plays very well
What more do you want
I can't eat any more
I can't eat more
I will prosper
Are you afraid of me
Are you scared of me
What will we become
What is your opinion
I know everything
We don't need her
We don't need you
We don't need them
This is not to his liking
I want to see her
Don't kid yourself
We ran short of money
Our money ran out
Our money ran out
She gave him the money
You don't look so good
You don't look well
I really need it
I am a boy
She listened to me
He gave me a watch
How many were there
Do you have a child
I love him more than anything
What does this look like to you
Please don't hate me
She had no money
That house belongs to me
I think she likes me
Do you want it
I must see it
I have to see this
I want to see it
Was that a yes
I know that he knows
Do you go with us
Are you coming along with us
I don't know everybody
I'm just looking
Can she see us
That was easy
Not everyone's the same
I have no time
I don't have time
I own this car
I know all of them
I know them all
I don't know where she lives
She is not afraid of anything
I know who you are
He doesn't listen to me
She doesn't listen to him
I came here yesterday
I want to live here
Do you love each other very much
How do you do that
The watch is slow
The clock is slow
How do you do that
How do you do this
Leave now
I can't leave now
I don't like either of them
I don't like both of them
I know who it was
You don't eat anything
What did he want
Does he love me
I gave Mary a book
They're late, as usual
She's really good looking
I have to do something
They're not afraid
I don't want to go
I was often there
There! She comes
There she comes
You are really very good
What do you like about me
What is written in the book
What's her name again
I can't hear it
I need you here
You're very fast
What do you like to eat
I see a book
You're doing fine
I still love Mary
What do you see in him
Is she coming, too
Does she know you
I have a friend
What don't you like
They weren't there
I see the book
I don't want to see you
He came into the room
He came by car
I only have one brother
I still hate you
Can I come over
You must do it
It was too late
I saw everything
She didn't go yesterday
Aren't you scared
Are you not frightened
Aren't you afraid
How do we do that
How do we do it
I'm filled with love for you
Is that clock going
I know what she said
I still have time
You have to do it
I'm coming
I also went
He relented
You don't work here
What am I to do
I'm not afraid any more
He no longer lives here
He doesn't live here anymore
You look very good
I have one brother
I just love that
How many does he want
Don't ask for money
The clock is fast
I like that
I like it
He's always been kind to me
He's on his last legs
I don't see much of him
Do you have any water
Everything's going to be OK
I'm not a child
I saw her there
She caught my eye
Please don't go away
Please don't go
He loves you
We don't have anything to eat
You know I can't
I don't need anything now
I do not understand you
I do not understand her
What does the cat want
It's your move
It's your turn
You can count me out on that
We're not alone
We aren't alone
We are not alone
Does your father know
Can he see me
You're here early
Am I still your boyfriend
He is no longer living here
He no longer lives here
He doesn't live there anymore
You don't look so good
You don't look well
Do you have much money with you
I don't have time right now
I don't have time now
I am not frightened of anything
I fear nothing
Nothing scares me
We have run short of food
Can I see that one
I don't get it
I don't understand this
I don't understand this
I don't understand it
I don't understand it
Please don't go away
Please don't go
He just arrived
I'll do that
He will always be with you
The dog will not harm you
We don't need you
I don't believe that
I don't believe it
I hate her now
You're unkind
Don't listen to her
Are you coming with me
I don't need them anymore
We don't have much time
We don't have a lot of time
We haven't got much time
We're out of money
I know who you are
He knows us very well
It was already too late
Everything here is mine
I don't get it
I don't understand it
I do not want any money
Do you have any water
She's eating for two
That would be fine
I want something to eat
I want some food
Open the door
Open the door
He is still standing
She's still alive
Don't kid yourself
He will not go
She was alone in the house
I love you, too
I want to live
I used to be like you
I'm not your mother
I arrived there too early
I arrived too early
I need the money
What do you want
But he doesn't know it yet
We don't need him
Do you really want it
I didn't tell you anything
Are you here alone
I want more money
We can't do that
We can't do it
We cannot do that
What are you doing here so early
He spends too much money
Do you live here
What's the point
Do you have a boyfriend
She took her book
They can't see me
Do you enjoy living like this
I always do that
I always do that
As you like
I want some money
Everything will be OK
Everything's going to be OK
You are late
I need you
You need it
She knows me
I wanted to do it, but could not
What do you see in him
I love my life
How's life going
You are too big
I'm still single
I am still alone
I am still alone
What are you two doing
How do you feel about it
I hate you
Everyone likes her
I am very tall
I know none of them
I don't hate you anymore
I think he likes me
I don't know where he lives
Right now I don't have any time
I would like this book
I am no longer a child
I can't eat
Do you know her
What a day
He knows everything
You are always late
It seems too much to me, too
He looks like a woman
You work too much
Let's do that
He loves us
I can't see
This clock is out of order
Don't walk so fast
I will be with you right away
I'll be with you in a second
You look very good
He, and he alone, must go
I would like to go with you
You're afraid of him
They're afraid of him
I won't leave
I won't go
I have good eyesight
Do you do that often
What are they doing
I am afraid
I'm afraid
He's really good looking
You are my friend
You're my friend
She and I are the same age
What is it now
What is your name
What's your name
What are you called
Without you, I'm nothing
I'm nothing without you
I think he likes you
What has that to do with me
What does that have to do with me
What does this have to do with me
He had no money
That's the way he likes it
Please come
Everything is going too fast
Don't close your eyes
You can do it
Can you do that
What does he want to do
I saw you there
I'm learning so much from you
He won't live long
I do not understand you
I want a boyfriend
You're afraid of him
I'm closing the door
I can do this myself
I like to eat
What are you wearing
Does she know you
This is where she lives
What does this mean
I don't need a car
Can you do it
I'll be present
I'm back
I think she was looking at you
Let's have a look
I will not be free tomorrow
I have no time tomorrow
You are not a child any more
You are no longer a child
You are not a child anymore
You're not a child anymore
It won't come to that
I'm still very tired
I can do it myself
I know what he said
I never saw him again
All are present
I'm really old
Don't listen to him
Where do they do that
Will you go with us
He has no hat on
He doesn't have a hat on
I saw her yesterday
I saw him there
You or I
We ran out of food
I'd like to see her
Are you not tired
They are not tired
She stood by him
That is going too far
I see something
I cannot eat anything today
I took care of her cat
Are you here alone
Stand up
What does that have to do with you
He no longer works here
He doesn't work here anymore
You can't eat here
I don't believe you
I don't trust you
Do you do that often
Do they do that often
We can't live like this
What do you want to do with it
How do you pronounce this
Will he be here soon
He'll be here soon
He will be here soon
He does not get up early
I see the dog
That was fast
I will never see him
Please don't be afraid
What do you want to be
I like your dog
I would like to see it
She listens to him
Who are they
Who are you
Who are you
He's getting old
You can't go yet
You can't leave yet
I'm your brother
I am your brother
They are among us
I see a house
What does this have to do with us
What does that have to do with us
Don't you see the clock
She is talking
Are you afraid
I live it
There's nothing to it
What does your father do
Do you have a lot of time
Who has it now
I see the house
They aren't my books
She is opening the window
What do you want to do with it
That's just the way she likes it
I still want to go
Can I have some more tea
What are you doing today
What am I doing here
Count me in
I'm game
I've never been so tired
You won't be needing that
They aren't my books
I need something to eat
I love my wife
I talk to you
I'm not sleepy
I am not tired
You're back again
Did she say something
Can I eat
I can come at three
Where've you been
Will you open the door
They don't like me
You don't like me
The house is owned by him
The house belongs to him
Everyone does it
I feel fine
I feel well
I feel good
I'm feeling good
What are you doing here
What're you doing here
We've been here before
He is afraid of the dog
We're late
Who has it now
Don't go in my room
I won't leave without you
I did it for her
How did you get into my house
We can't see it
He'll be here again
I like being alone
She stood up
Do you live here
Here he comes
We still have a lot of time
That sounds good
What will they do
You are afraid
Do you have this in a bigger size
Her brother looked at her
They're now alone
Everybody likes him
That's not my name
You can't go yet
You can't leave yet
He got up and went away
I know where she lives
He looks like his father
He takes after his father
You are tired, and so am I
I am not eating
I'm going to see her tomorrow
And what are we doing now
I am like my mother
I'm free today
Fear prevails
Who am I
I looked into his eyes
I am no longer tired
Did you hear it
You're very nice
I'll live
I don't see anything
I can't see anything
I don't see anything
I'm on my own
I'm taking off now
I'm leaving now
I'm going
I'm going
Do you live here
I need a lot of them
He doesn't eat this, does he
I know where she lives
Don't do this to me
I wasn't afraid
She came out of the room
What did she say
It's about time
I told him nothing
She's not supposed to be here
Where's everyone
Aren't you sleepy
You're looking good
I think he was looking at you
What do you want
Do you have a car
She needs you
I am getting old
Are they all the same
She didn't go far
And what are we going to do
You're a good friend
It dawns on me
Are any meals included
We're out of time
They'll be afraid
What are your plans for today
How about your place
Are we nearly there yet
Don't be afraid
As you wish
Are you free
Somebody was in the house
This book belongs to me
This book is mine
What don't I understand
Your watch gains time
Don't say too much
There's a car coming
She did not say anything
She said nothing
You again
I know neither of them
I do not know any of them
He knows neither of us
He doesn't know anyone of us
He knows none of us
He doesn't know any of us
That's how I would do it
He is in front of the door
He's standing outside the door
The dog ran towards me
I don't have a boyfriend
I didn't have time
That's what you think
I'll be there tomorrow
You are to come with me
I need you to come with me
You must come with me
You must come with me
He's still alive
We'll do it tomorrow
We still have time
What do you like to eat
It was yesterday that I saw him
Are you free now
I feel it now
We sure don't want that
Do what you like
I can't live on my own
You are tired, and so am I
I love being alone
I don't know exactly
How do you feel about it
This book is hers
You again
How far along are you
You're cooperating
She is listening to him
She listens to him
What do you have
You have to come with me
I've known him for a long time
I'm just a teacher
Can I leave now
Can I go now
Tell me about it
I'm very tired
How was your day
What's eating her
Do you have any shirt in white
I want some water
Please do something
How much is it
How much does that cost
How much does this cost
How much does it cost
How much will it be
He likes money
I was very tired
You don't scare me
You can't scare me
You don't frighten me
They wear very little clothing
I'm very tired now
I don't have any brothers
I don't have a brother
He will be free tomorrow
May I do it right now
My father drives very well
You know what I want
What kind of food do you like to eat
How often do you see her
I'll eat here
I work for you
Will you go with us
Come along with us
How much is it
What're you doing here
What do they do there
It's up to you
He stood in front of me
He was getting old
Who are you
Who are you
I did it for him
How tall you are
How tall are you
How did you get into my house
She doesn't live there any more
Who has it now
You mean a lot to me
Today I am very tired
How was your day today
The dog was running toward him
Do you know us
We don't need you
What do you want to be
Please, tell me
You are a good boy
Not all girls are like that
I will speak to you tomorrow
He is opening the window
He opens the window
He lives above me
I want to eat
Don't come again
Life lies in front of you
He went out of the room
He left the room
Doesn't that sound good
I play with him
She always gets up early
You are taller than she
They are taller than she
Do you know what I mean
Don't listen to the man
Please, listen to me
You're not supposed to be here
You can't leave now
She knows where we live
I said nothing
Does he live here
You can't go
And what do you do
He broke into a house
I've got too much to do
This book belongs to you
Does this book belong to you
This book is yours
Not so fast
She wants to go
Never in a lifetime
He wouldn't even look at me
My car is not running
I need a little more time
He wasn't even there
He speaks really well
I want to eat something
I don't like English
I'll be right there
Have you got the money
Do you do that often
I want to be your boyfriend
I'm all alone here
I'm taller than you
She asked me for money
He'll become a father soon
Can I see
I love my mother very much
You don't need to go
I do not like both of them
He and I are teachers
He and I are teachers
I'm taller than you
You must eat something
I like your car
Who is coming with me
Who will come with me
You don't eat anything
We need this
Does he live here
What are you doing
What do you make
What is his name
What's his name
After you
I'll be glad to
Is there anything I can do for you
Can I do anything for you
My father loves us
She gets up early
You're looking good
I am better than you
I know everybody here
I will do it gladly
What's wrong with me
I know where he lives
They are big
Are they tall
Day began to break
You must eat something
What are you doing today
I hear only you
I want to see everything
We have plenty of time
We've got plenty of time
We have a lot of time
I believe in you
What do you need
I don't do anything
I'm so tired
I'm so worn out
He's not supposed to be here
What is wrong with her
Are you free tomorrow
Don't fool yourself
You again
You need it
Here and there
You're good at this
You can't go
Shall I go together with you
I have to leave now
I have got to go now
I must leave now
Got to go now
I must be going now
I've got to go now
I have to go now
I must be leaving now
I must go now
Suit yourself
He came too fast
It was time to leave
I'm learning so much from you
I no longer work here
Can we do that
Your father loves you
Are we alone
They are both good
She needs you
How much is it
How much does that cost
How much does this cost
How much does it cost
How much is this
How much is that
How much is it
Who wants it
He has more books than I do
Are you out of work
I don't work here
The dog is theirs
That's MY line
I believe in him
I assume so
I want to go
How do you feel about it
You've got to see her home
You are taller than she
How often do you see him
There was nothing in the box
I don't want to eat anything
I do not understand you
You are my mother
We can do that
I work for you
Are you free tomorrow
Where are you
What's your location
I don't want a boyfriend
Can they see me
I know that well
I suppose so
But now I love you
I had a good time
I can't do this
I am alluding to Mary
He's so good looking
I have to leave now
Ought I to go
I must go now
Do I have to go
I need to go
I have a question to pose you
I've got a question for you
I call her very often
I'm a good mother
I'm taller than you
They need the money
You aren't alone
What are you doing now
What are you doing right now
I am tall
I'm big
I'm tall
I'm not your friend
I'm no friend of yours
Do you have anything to eat
You're not a child anymore
I'll be with you in a second
I'm waiting for her to come here
They are not coming today
What'll we do
I don't quite know yet
He is soon to be a father
He will soon be a father
He will soon become a father
Did the car look old
Can I do anything for you
You're a teacher
Don't come
He stood up
They won't come until tomorrow
I'd like three of these
We don't have to go
Don't work too much
This is what I want
That's what I want
What are you doing here so early
It's free of charge
How long are you going to be
You don't scare me
You are taller than I
How could it be
Would you like to see it now
What's this doing here
I will be back soon
I'll be back soon
Do you work here
Everyone does it
That's what everyone does
We want a car
My brother has no money
And what do you do
What do you plan on doing tonight
What are your plans for tonight
They won't come
I know who you are
Do you see anything
I've still got a lot of work to do
I don't like this hat
But I don't have money
But I have no money
She was there in the morning
This house is mine
That house is mine
What do you mean you don't know?
Don't you know how
I do not understand
I don't understand
They don't see me anymore
He does not live there any more
He does not live there any more
I need more money
Who doesn't love her
How many were there
I know it myself
I see your house
What does she want
Can I see, too
How old do I look
I think we're OK
I don't think so
Go without me
Here comes the train
The train is arriving
I don't know English
I like your dog
I need to see you immediately
I can do without this
That was right of them
I'm not talking to you
He knows where we live
Do that for me
I'll be there tomorrow
Are you all alone
We're alone
Are we alone
I know exactly where I am
Close your eyes
I think he's faking
I understand that
You're not young anymore
I can do without this
I'll ring you back
We need you
I live here
That car is hers
What are you doing
We lack nothing
He asked me for money
I have a question to pose you
I've got a question for you
I can't go alone
I'm in need of money
I need money
I was not a good mother
I can do it by myself
I can do it myself
I am taller than he
She really wants to go
I live in the house
He knows exactly what he wants
He didn't say anything
He said nothing
I will eat
Does she know you
What do you see
How long were you there
How can I get to heaven
Don't you want to go
The train is coming
She lives with him
What do you want to do today
He has too many books
There was only one left
You are in my way
You're in my way
You're in my way
You're in the way
I need some water
He is not coming, apparently
Have you a carriage here
He came by bus
What did you say your name was
It'll soon be three o'clock
Don't walk so fast
I'm better than him
My father became old
He was standing at the door
I saw him enter the house
That's not a proper thing to say
Need he go right now
Don't you have any money
I never hear anything
It's getting late
He is unable to do it
She knows that you know
We've got time
Do we have time
I hear you
What do you want to do
So far, so good
He took off her clothes
That can't be
We're almost there
It's up to you to do it
I'd like to see her
She likes the teacher
I saw that coming
He's getting up early
He gets up early
It explains a lot
I'll see you around
I'll see you around
I will see you around
See you later
What's her name again
Do you want me to leave
You don't need to go
I want to see, too
People don't say that anymore
That's not a proper thing to say
Do you like to be alone
The man stood up
Where does she live now
She bragged about it
Do you know how to do this
I know that you know
It is said that he is still alive
People say that he's still alive
I hear that he's still alive
They say that he's still alive
They are all alike
She avoids me
She is quick at everything
I need a little time
I am not a teacher
I'm not a teacher
What a sentence
He approached the door
You have everything
Do you have everything
What am I eating
The train is arriving soon
These are my books
Those are my books
Those are my books
They are the same age
I'm taking a book
She doesn't want to get out of bed
I like having plenty to do
I eat here
I've run out of milk
She had no brother
I like your eyes
I'm taking the book
I have a lot of work to do tomorrow
I need it by tomorrow
He just doesn't listen
You're not young anymore
She opened the door
I still have things left to do
I don't believe you
You have him there
Read after me
What do you have in your hand
I need this money
I want to see more
Are you all alone
What is it that you want me to do
I live life
Here comes the train
She can come
He wants to go
I'm afraid at night
I want to do it myself
I bought a book
She needs the money
I'll do it now
We miss you very much
We miss you a lot
Do you see him often
Listen to this
Is that clock working
They are in the way
They're on their way
Was that you in the car
I am free from work today
I don't have enough
He's working in the car
I do not like this song
He talks too fast
He speaks too fast
Something's not right
It should be like this
That's how it should be
I'm late
What do you have in your hand
This book belongs to you
This book is yours
You don't need the money
I'm late, aren't I
What could she mean
There is a time for everything
There is a right time for everything
See you tomorrow
It can't be helped
It cannot be helped
There's nothing to be done about it
That can't be helped
It's just one of those things
We were here yesterday
He knows no English
He doesn't know English
Doesn't it taste good
You don't know them
Eat everything
You don't need to go at once
This car handles very easily
I'm talking about you
I hate my life
What will you make
I'm tired now
What do you want to do now
I'm getting better
I am watching a film
Does everybody want it
Do you know each other
I love things that are beautiful
I'm behind him
I'm after him
I also think so
I know what she did
Today I have a lot of things to do
I have a lot to do today
I have a lot of work to do today
I have a lot to do today
Do you want to see more
I've finished reading that book
She has no children
I'm on my way
That won't work
I understand you
I understand you
You must be here by five
I wasn't even there
She's feeling much better
You can do it, can't you
Do as he tells you
Do you have to go now
We're meeting up tomorrow
See you tomorrow
Are we meeting tomorrow
See you tomorrow
He can do what he wants
The boy has no food
You're up early
Do you know where we are
He never fails to do what he says
We saw them leave
He will always love her
The radio doesn't work
Do you still love her
I'm a good teacher
How long are you going to be
You can't eat the money
I'm not a baby, you know
I was tired today
Will she come
We've been there before
Are they still in bed
Do it as you are told
I'm the man of the house
I do not work
I am not working
They are eating just now
So be it
He does this all the time
I was really scared
Somebody was in the house
What does he want
I can't work like this
I have lived here a long time
I am reading a book now
He looks very tired
He knows that you know
I'll be back
Are you tired
We need the money
Do you like to be alone
I barely know you
I barely know her
I hardly know her
I'm calling you
I have many things to do
I have a lot of things to do
He shut the door
I'm afraid of the bus
What will you do tomorrow
I will do it right now
She always got up early
Do you like your car
He looked very tired
How kind of you
He took off his clothes
There's too much to do
Are you through with the book
I'll be alone
Could this be love
My friend has arrived
I'm right
I'm right
I am right
I am right
Am I right
I believe you
I don't feel well
I'm not feeling well
Do you want something to eat
Do you want to eat anything
Do as you want
Do as you like
Do whatever you want
Was the movie good
The movie was good
We need something to eat
How many books do you have
My father gets up early
It's been a long night
He wants a new car
What do you know about him
The doctor gave it to her
I have almost no money now
I will be right back
Did he look like a doctor
I know what I want to do
I am disgusted with him
He often comes late
He saw the girl
I can do without it
The automobile stopped
I hear something
Are you through with the book
He could do it
Where is he playing
I'm gaining weight
They are both in the room
Both of them are in the room
Don't you have anything to do
I have a lot of work to do tomorrow
I have a question to pose you
You're going to have to leave
Be on your guard against her
I love my mother
You're not a doctor
Where will you be
How many books do you have
What does this mean
This is really delicious
We'll be there
I don't like studying
I have two eyes
I'm very sleepy today, too
He has nothing to do
He's better looking than me
Her boyfriend did it for her
I'm not ready yet
How many books does he have
I am not your son
I work for you
Be nice to her
I walked alone
I'm doing this for them
I'm doing this for her
I'll call you up tomorrow
Never have I felt better
I've never been better
I have never felt better
I'll come back tomorrow
It tastes very good
What do you want to eat
It is not raining
Who knows that
I'm tired
I'm sleepy
I am tired
I am tired
I'm tired
We haven't met yet
I can’t stand her
I don't have any children
I see this house
I'm not sick
Don't do this
Are you are feeling better today
She wants to come
I was tired
Where are the girls
We can do nothing about it
All the time I was there
She doesn't need to go there herself
I don't like that sentence
He may come today
I can live with that
Do you have a lot to do
We've all been there
She has more books
She's got more books
What do you want to see
What do you want to watch
She came alone
He doesn't even listen to me
I think about her a lot
Here today and gone tomorrow
That house belongs to him
What do you mean by it
What do you mean by that
I just work here
I feel old
Where do you all live
She has to come
She needs to come
You have to go
You must go
You need to go
How much is a room
Those are their books
I could see that
You scare me
You're scaring me
I'm not a doctor
I am not a doctor
I'm not a doctor
I'll buy you a drink
He is a good match for me
Please come again
This is where my father works
My father works here
Go to your room
This should be fun
I've been better
Do you want to see more
I give you a book
They're still young
I am coming
I'm coming right away
Where do you live
She's dating my brother
She didn't want to do it
Who will do it
You need to go
What are you doing tonight
We've run out of tea
We're out of tea
I love to hate you
You're a beautiful woman
He looks a bit tired
You're afraid of him
I want to go to my bed
I want to go to bed
She slammed the door shut
Will you do it for me
Do you hear something
I'd like to be alone
I've got to leave soon
I'm waiting for him
I'm waiting for him
I wasn't listening to the radio
Do you want to be my friend
This book belongs to you
Does this book belong to you
This book is yours
You can go now
I know what he did
How am I supposed to eat
She cooks for him
She is cooking for him
I don't hear anything
Everyone has been there
You can do it, can't you
I like this job
He needs the money
I barely know you
I hardly know you
I don't want that
I am not older than he is
She doesn't drink
I have time tomorrow morning
That can't be true
That cannot be true
It can not be true
This can't be true
She's got the measure of you
I'd like to go, too
Do you still love him
He drinks too much
I will always love you
I'll always love you
I'll love you always
I will love you forever
I don't know him at all
It looks like an apple
She asked me to do it
You're right
Are you correct
She means nothing to him
I need more time
Does your mother know
Better her than me
He arrived late
I didn't mean to do it
She had a little money
It cannot be true
It can't be true
I will do anything for him
I can see it in your eyes
I'm doing this for you
I don't have enough money
I don't know exactly where
Do you know what that means
To be or not to be
What could he mean
What could he mean
They don't know us
I'm still young
I love games
Don't drink that
I want to come
He was the last to leave
I didn't want to do it
He looked out of the window
Are you not tired
There still remains much to be done
There's still much to do
A lot still remains to be done
There are still a lot of things to do
Just water, please
Is he right
Is he correct
Who's watching
Are you tired
He asked for more money
You don't need that
I barely know him
I hardly know him
You're going
I'm doing this for him
She hates him
What're you saying
I like tea
I like living here
We're out of milk
He gave them food and money
Life doesn't get any better
He has no children
He hasn't any children
He doesn't have any children
How many children do you have
I'd like to see them both
He had fun with her
Will you do it for me
She doesn't want kids
She doesn't want to have children
I know the girl
I'm not giving up
You're going with us
I think this is mine
She looks very young
Do you know who they are
I'm only thinking of you
I only think of you
How about tonight
I was just about to leave
Yes, we can
He has another son
She must do it now
I'll give you anything that you want
I will give you whatever you want
I will give you anything you want
I'll give you anything you want
The man is right
You're so young
How dare you
How dare you
I am more beautiful than you
I can't stand him
He's feeling much better
She doesn't understand me
Do you want something to eat
I don't like kids
Where could she be
She pointed at him
He can come
I can see it in your eyes
How many children do you have
I am more beautiful than you
She wanted to be alone
Is his father alive
But where are we
I'll take him
They're right behind me
It's out of the question
That's not an option
We're always right
Do you know what I mean
I only have two children
I only have one question
I just have one question
I think about him a lot
I have been busy today
I've had a busy day
There is always something to do
I like both
I know your father
We don't know her
We do not know her
How often does it rain here
She got the money from him
I stayed up all night
I was up all night
He came as lately as yesterday
I'm hitting the road
He got on the train
I'm not mad at you
These are my parents
Do you know who I am
Do you know who I am
We don't have tea
I can speak English
You're still young
Don't believe him
I'm busy
I am busy
I am busy
I'm busy
Will you go, too
I eat everything
I asked him to do that
Apart from that, I don't know anything
I don't like it at all
I'll be busy tomorrow
How tall you are
I don't have a car anymore
I want another beer
Tomorrow morning will be OK
I must do it now
There were too many people there
Be on your guard against him
He walked rapidly
I don't want kids
I don't want to have children
What do you want to eat
Don't be so angry
Don't get so excited
What is this car doing here
How dare you
I have many books
I have a lot of books
I don't think so
Please come
He's coming
He is arriving shortly
Go back to work
Get back to work
Anything new today
Is there anything new today
How many windows are there
He doesn't know both of us
He doesn't know both of us
I know both of them
All of us like her
How do you say that
How does that sound
Need he go right now
I would like to see it
We have to leave now
We have to go now
What's wrong with this
Something is not right
What do you want to see
What do you want to watch
Yes, I can
What am I supposed to do with that
I pointed at him
I'm probably wrong
I'm right behind her
Where does he live
I must go right away
Do I have to go right now
She is having dinner
She called me
He can't be ill
He cannot be ill
I can see the light
Who will come with me
How lucky I am
You have all these books
There wasn't anyone in the room
We can do it ourselves
He drives very fast
She seems tired
She looks tired
I'm eating now
I'm eating
I am eating
He will come
How does that sound
We don't have to do that
I wasn't busy
I don't know what to do
We have a lot of work to do
We have a lot to do
We have lots to do
What is it that you do, exactly
Is anyone else going
I want a job
They're right behind you
I am sick only now
I am more beautiful than you
He didn't want to do it
She spoke up for him
He asked for money
She didn't say a word
She lies here beside me
He asked me to do it
Sounds good to me
That sounded good
I love her eyes
I love you both
I love both of you
Are you busy
They are busy
Do as he tells you
I have two books
The light went on
I need a new car
I don't want to go to bed
You are entirely correct
You may go
Can you walk
Do you have money
That big one is also mine
I can't hate you
I cannot hate you
He was a tall man
Are you coming or not
How was your night
She's wearing a hat
She is wearing a hat
He is reading a book
He has a crush on this girl
There is nothing to do today
I know your father
I want to see it for myself
I'm seeing them tonight
Expect me when you see me
It looks as if you're right
Are you are feeling better today
I'm right behind you
That was never my problem
I like your room
I bought her a clock
Are you angry with me
I see the girl
He must love you
There was nobody there
What is the man saying
How kind of you
Mary knows me
Are you busy
Get to work
There is the train at 10 o'clock
Like father, like son
But I wasn't afraid
You are always late
Do you know his name
He was angry with her
What kind of reading do you like to do
I'm thinking about you
The father works
What does he say
What is he saying
She looks very sick
I'm angry with her
She pretended that she was sick
How lucky you are
I will be back soon
I'll be back soon
I'll come back soon
He doesn't understand you
The teacher is coming along
You're quite right
You're perfectly right
You are absolutely correct
How much is this watch
How much is this clock
You will never be alone
I know what you are thinking
I know what you're thinking
I just don't understand
Do you want to leave now
They are all of a size
Even a child knows that
Even a child knows that
The sun is rising already
I have to go to the doctor today
She must be angry with me
He pretended to be a doctor
I won't hurt you
I ran out of the house
You have many books
We shall see
We'll see
I talk to you
I'm talking to you
This is not true
It's not true
That's untrue
Isn't that right
Let's be going now
We're leaving now
She called him
He came quickly
It just doesn't work that way
What a big dog that is
What a big dog
You look very tired
They look very tired
We were very tired
The lights went out
She isn't running
Do you have this new book
I have little money now
She dressed herself quickly
Do you know who he was
She must be angry with me
I am a teacher, too
I, too, am a teacher
I'm also a teacher
Does he have many books
They all look the same
I just want to have fun
We'll go after we eat
I'll be there right away
He wants to come
I'm a teacher
It was night
He came really fast
I like this dog
I didn't know that
I did not know this
I have a bicycle
Better him than me
I want a beer
We've got a problem here
She met him this morning
The sun is rising now
He must do it now
What else do you have
Yes, I understand you well
I don't agree with him
I'll come, too
You are very beautiful
I was a teacher
I was a teacher
Almost always
I'm crazy about you
I'm crazy for you
We need to eat
Where do you work
He has to come
No one said anything to me
She kissed me, not him
Do you have this new book
She became very ill
He hardly ever works
We don't know him
We do not know him
It was so beautiful
We walked to my room
She said her name was Mary
They all look the same
I have a problem
I am living from day to day
I love this job
I would very much like to go
He has a little money
Hand me that book, please
We aren't that poor
What does that have to do with it
These things aren't mine
How I miss you
She doesn't speak English
What else do you have
Do you have two books
You have two books
You may go
Can you walk
I think she hates me
What's her name again
They're mad at you
I'll be your teacher
He doesn't want kids
What fun
How beautiful you are today
Do you have children already
Don't you believe me
I gave him a call
I phoned him
I called him
You know what he said
That has nothing to do with it
I hate myself
Where will we eat
My father has a lot of books
This hat suits me nicely
It hardly ever rains there
Don't do this to me
I don't speak fast
I'm feeling sort of tired
I'm feeling kind of tired
I seldom speak to him
How old are the kids
You'll need more
He doesn't understand me
I think about her often
I think about them often
I'm not ready
She hates her life
I get the point
We all like him
I'm speaking
I'm talking
Where could he be
I work here
It's still raining
Is it still raining
He gave me back the money
The room has two windows
I think you're right
Please don't hate me
Shall I have that box
You're not young anymore
How's my wife doing
Are you still angry with me
I wasn't ready
I will do it myself
Do you need money
We'll go
I do think so
He doesn't drink
I know his brother well
I'm feeling fine now
Where did she buy a book
I want to be a teacher
We don't know each other
What's new
I'd like a glass of water
I'd like to have a glass of water
I believe that it can be done
It's his, isn't it
I'm feeling pretty good
Don't give me that
Get out of bed
Not again
Can he speak English
I believe you
Where're the shoes
Now they have three children
She was not quick enough
Who wants to do that
It grew larger and larger
She shook my hand
I became very ill
Let's get in the house
Here comes the bus
Here comes the bus
Who are you
Who are you all
Who are you
Never again
Are you coming
I think you're right
That we are not able to do
I think you're right
I think that you're right
How was your night
He must be tired
She looked at me and laughed
I am studying now
I'll join you later
I want to see the movie
I want to watch the film
I have a little money
I hear you
I hear what you're saying
I think he is right
I think that he is right
I think he's right
I think he's correct
Now I understand
What does it mean
What does this mean
What does that mean
You are a teacher
Please do it quickly
Am I talking too fast
He lives here all alone
Mum's the word
I'm thinking about you
I'm thinking of you
I see and hear
They had only one child
You look very tired
He doesn't understand you
Is there water
I can live without water
I'm older than you
There's a lot to do
There’s a lot of work to do
She has three children
She has three kids
Where are your eyes
He has a bicycle
Do you feel better today
Are you are feeling better today
Yes, I understand you well
Anyway
He was only shamming
I'm just doing my job
I'm just doing my job
Let's go at our work
What are we having for supper
I always walk
We have to go
We need to leave
We need to go
Is it necessary for us to go
You will have to come tomorrow
What's this dog's name
I barely know you
Suits me fine
You're so beautiful
He followed in his father's footsteps
Everything appears to be going well
That hat becomes you
I ran for my life
What do you want to do with it
He did well in school
You must hurry up
She got up late
He looks tired
He seems tired
We're all going
We're all going
I am taller
It's raining here
The cat was on the table
Can he do this job
What are you doing tonight
I don't want to work
I do not want to work
I have two children
I have a question
I've got a question
How lucky we are
How lucky we are
It doesn't mean anything
Doesn't that mean anything
Nobody likes her
What do you know
I'm right behind him
Your house be my house
I'm not leaving here
How's school
I'd like to go
They will come
Did we have it
You don't work here
They are good people
He didn't like being poor
She showed me her room
She is a good English speaker
She is good at speaking English
She speaks good English
It wasn't you, was it
I looked in the window
Who is he talking to
How kind of you
What is the woman saying
I work a lot
I will never do it again
I'll never do it again
I'm reading this book
I wouldn't do that
Do you want to leave now
He didn't know that
It sickens me
I am better
I'm better
Something's missing
The radio died
She doesn't have any children, does she
These books are very old
It wasn't my idea
I miss him
You're going to have to leave
He didn't know that
Where do you want to eat
I'll be free this evening
I'm free tonight
I'd like to have a cat
What shall I do with it
We're out of beer
We've run out of beer
I had a wonderful time
I'm not crazy
He will come soon
You have three cats
Do you enjoy it
You have to come
Where does he work
You're not fast enough
I only saw the apple
Do you have a son
Come into the room
Do you love me
The new car is hers
I think about him often
I didn't want milk
You are too late
You're too late
You think too much
I will go at 10
I know she is sleeping
Not a word was said
You know it better than me
He took her in his arms
She misses him
The sun is coming up
The sun is rising
He looked up at the sky
I'll do it
I have been waiting for a long time
Where could the cat be
There's no beer here
What do you think of him
I see you every now and then
What are you going to do with it
I'd like a fish
Are you all alone
Do you like it then
You have to come
He has little money
What are you reading
It's now or never
Now or never
We have things to do
Her father died
You are a doctor
Are you a doctor
It won't be a problem
I think he hates me
What's his name again
I am fine, and you
It was only a dream
I hear from her once in a while
How beautiful you are
I always have a tired feeling
He arrived rather late
I'm a little tired
I'm a bit tired
I telephoned her at once
I see him once in a while
In fact
I don't have a bicycle
I'll be right back
I live here alone
I can't do anything
I waited for her for a long time
I don't want to be rich
Are you free tonight
You like it, don't you
Please come again
Something's not right
There's something wrong
I want an apple
I waited for you
Whose book is this
Do you want to go
Do you wish to go
He did not have enough money
I know that you live here
All of us know him well
He got what he wanted
No one speaks with me
Do you have a question
I like to work
It wasn’t the first time
Do you really want me to leave
He became very ill
Where are the children
Do it like he tells you
Don't be upset
We see each other every day
Does it rain there very often
What do you like about her
I wrote that book
He spoke very well
You can do better than this
That wasn't so hard
She testified against him
It'll be a big day
I got up early yesterday
I wish I had much money
He knows no English
He can't speak English
He doesn't know English
I'm waiting for your wife
They're about to leave
We are his children
I have a table
That woman knows where I live
I'm very proud of you
He was not quick enough
Do whatever he tells you
I know that he reads
I know that he's reading
It wasn't that difficult
Will you go, too
What is the doctor doing
Nothing is missing
It's getting larger
You should eat something
What's your friend's name
What is your friend's name
You work too much
She seldom goes out
There are almost no books
I see with my eyes
Shall you be able to come tomorrow
What is the price of this watch
She took her time
I was just going to do that
I did it for you
I did it for her
She always speaks English
And the boy did
You cannot do this
I was very scared
Please do this for me
You don't know them
You're my son
Do they love each other
I'm a doctor
I am a doctor
He doesn't talk to me anymore
I'd never do something like that
I have lived here a long time
How fast the train is running
How fast the train runs
What was the problem
I have to do something
I need to do something
I began the book
He gave me his word
This sure tastes good
I miss her a lot
Are you out of work
She cooks for him every day
It gets better
Yes, I'm coming
What are you reading
Do you like to be alone
You are absolutely right
You're quite right
You can say that again
You're completely right
You're completely right
You're absolutely right
You're perfectly right
You are completely right
You're absolutely right
You are entirely correct
You are absolutely correct
You're totally right
You're absolutely right
They'll do it
Don't I owe you something
I am older than him
I'm having dinner now
I'm eating dinner now
It tastes really good
How is your wife doing
You should eat something
My father was a tree
She doesn't speak to me
Watch what you're doing
Where are my books
Are you free tomorrow
I'm reading this book
I love the sun
Do you want me to leave
Here they come
I read a lot
Yes, I think so, too
That's all she has
He is quite right
I am listening to a song
He talks fast
I'm young
Nothing much is happening yet
I will do anything but that
This makes me very angry
She fed milk to the cat
I'm going to be a teacher
Let's get some lunch
I don't want to study today
How old are your kids
I don't like school
I do not like the rain
I was at school
Are they coming as well
I can love
She is putting on weight
Where is everybody
I can't go home
How is your dad
How's your father
Do you know where he lives
I'd like a tea
What are you doing this evening
What are you doing tonight
I crossed the street
I am calling my father
The television doesn't work
The TV doesn't work
Everything is going very well
What do they want
Is something wrong
Is there something wrong
What do I have to do
She lives alone
It wasn't her idea
These shoes are hers
He hasn't got a bicycle
He has no bicycle
He has three children
Do as you please
I believe you
You're old enough now
He got angry with us
She shook hands with him
I'll be back at six
Shall you be able to come tomorrow
I need some milk
Can I go to work
We must do it now
Who loves you
Please do something
You are tired, aren't you
You don't need to go
Do I have to do it right away
He slammed his door shut
Just do what you've got to do
I'm very proud of you
I want a coffee
He seems kind
Don't do it again
You may go at once
We have work to do
Do you have a table
I'm already rich
I did this for you
The car is running fast
I need a medic
I need a doctor
Do you have children
Do you have kids
I'm fed up
What are you thinking about
That's how I would do it
I did it for you
You don't know me
I'm not angry
Let's go
Let's go
Shall we go
We're leaving
We'll go
We're going
All things must have an end
Everything must come to an end
Don't ever do that again
This tastes good
Be a man
I often talk to him on the bus
She looks young
She still has much to learn
Give it to me, please
If he has time, he will come
It wasn't his idea
He speaks English well
I'll call my husband
Are you still angry
Are you still mad
That day shall come
Do you want to risk that
Be kind to Mary
You are a doctor
Are you a doctor
She kicked me out of the house
I really have to go now
I want a family
Are you still in love with your wife
Do you still love your wife
I see that it is raining
Give it to me, please
I had fun here
What are you thinking about
I'm going to my house
I'm much younger than you
Do you know her
They know her
I am fond of reading
I like reading
I like to read
I can't read this
I'm not at all tired
I'm not tired at all
I met him in the crowd
I don't like coffee
It's very fun
I think so, too
I will go on foot
Next person, please
Father and brother
We've got a problem
We have a problem
Both are alive
You're too late
How are your parents doing
Are your parents in now
I believe that's correct
I hate my job
I see him once in a while
What is it that you do, exactly
I can hardly hear you
Can you come
I'm the bad one
Do you have children
How far do we have to go
It makes me so angry
Who do you think I am
Do you want to do this now
I am watching a film
Can we go
Don't open your book
We will do anything for you
Don't close the door
This is simply not true
What does money mean to you
Does he have any children
Has he any children
I have nothing else
You must see a doctor
I still have a lot to learn
I'll call him tonight
I go to bed very early
I miss you very much
You don't run here
She always believes me
Everyone likes her
How old are your kids
Two plus two makes four
She kicked him out of the house
My dear mother
Wait for me
It won't be easy
You have such beautiful eyes
He asked for a glass of water
We need some money
He'll do well
Can it be true
How happy I am today
I was at a loss for an answer
Are you through with the book
I'm hardly ever home
I have to go to work
I feel very ill
I like your car
I have enough money
I like dogs very much
I don't do that
We love them
How does this work
How happy I am today
How long are you going to be
How many books do you have
Whose is this food
He walked across the street
He crossed the street
A child needs love
Is this hat yours
I miss him a lot
I had a lot of fun
I'm thinking about you
You know I can't
Do you know what that means
I used to be rich like you
He doesn't understand you
I have got to go now
There's no but about it
Everyone is tired
She loves to cook
Everyone left, except for us
The dog looks sick
The dog seems sick
He seems tired
I know that girl
Aren't you happy
That doesn't mean anything to me
This doesn't mean a thing to me
Give me the book
She gets tired quickly
It wasn't easy
I'm the bad one
What does he want to do
I thought it was pretty good
They are very far away
She's writing a book
I don't think so
What do you think about the book
That's all they have
We have two kids
We have two children
Are you coming
They're coming
Please don't go away
I have a big house
It was a mistake on their part
You don't know that
Can you come
Do you live alone
He took his time
You don't even know how
He and I are friends
We eat so we can live
She loves her boyfriend
We're quite tired
This isn't fun
We were all tired
I am a man
I'm a human being
I agree with you
How old do you think she is
I want that shirt too
Are you paying attention
I want kids
I like to learn new things
We're like family
He looked quite tired
How many do you need
She must be sick
I'm feeling tired
How does the song go
I'm more than happy
You're so young
He arrived with me
I'll take this one
It's raining
Is it raining right now
Is it raining now
That didn't work
I suppose they are coming
He was right after all
There’s not enough water
He is playing in his room
I only have ten books
You shall want for nothing
That wasn't my mistake
This wasn't my mistake
I'm very happy
He can't read it
I'm not well
I love books
Do they do that often
Do you do that often
I live here
They're gone
Almost three
Nearly three
What shall we eat tonight
What do we eat tonight
I bade good night to her
I wished her a good night
She turned off the lights
It didn't work
Come again tomorrow
Come back tomorrow
You should eat more
We need more time
You have no heart
At seven I'll be back
She took me by the hand
I will give it to you
Be nice to her
I understand
I have a big dog
She doesn't have to know
Well, that was quick
I want to play, too
I'm mad at you
I found the book easy
They have a large house
They don't know yet
I will be at home tomorrow
How far are you going
Where do you see the books
With whom are you eating dinner
These are my friends
She gets up at seven
From now on, we'll do it this way
Does this look good on me
He still has much to learn
He doesn't like coffee
I am already prepared
Do you have enough money
My uncle gave me a book
You don't need to study today
Do you think I need to go
Listen to your father
What's that called
I hit on a good idea
I am sick
I'm ill
I'm sick
I'm sick
I feel better today
I feel myself better today
I feel myself better today
Someone might see us
He has quite a little money
There are only three days left
My watch keeps good time
Do you want to risk that
It was yesterday that I met her
He has enough money
Mary has three kids now
Everyone's going
You should eat more
Where are your kids
She is likely to come
Do you believe me now
Get away from here
He was very poor
I don't want to know about it
I can't stand it
Mother is making tea for us
I'll give you this money
He ran away for his life
Come into the room
Do you need a car
Whose is this
Who does this belong to
It serves you right
I don't want to know
Does he have a big house
He ran for his life
I need a lot of books
It has to be true
Who do you think you are
She'll be back soon
I'm very proud of you
That was very easy
What will they do
I am leaving at four
Believe you me
Believe me
We will have to do something
Do you want me to wait
I have to go to bed
Do you know each other
I'm reading
I'm out of here
I'd like a glass of water, please
A glass of water, please
Open your eyes
He looks young
The woman drinks the water
I didn't like it
I'll be glad to
It serves you right
I'm going to your house
There is no going back
There's no going back
No one knows
Nobody knows this
Do you know him
I think she's going to be sick
I know where you live
He looks like a horse
Will it rain tomorrow
He is putting on weight
Yes, I'm coming immediately
What is the name of the movie
One of us has to go
He seems to know us
You don't have to come
He took her by the hand
We are at home today
We are at home today
He needs money
He lives alone
I'm back
We're young
What hat do you like
She was only half alive
My father swims very well
Are you pleased with your new house
The old man said something
You are tired, aren't you
Read it after her
It's driving me crazy
This is driving me crazy
Please look for it
She cooks well
Dawn is coming
Can you do that again
I don't see a man
How I miss you
I'm looking for my watch
They want to make it bigger
I'm right, aren't I
What do you want to do now
He asked for some money
When he heard it, he jumped
Do you know how to speak English
You know English
Where are my parents
I'm so happy
There is one problem
What is it that you do, exactly
It won't help you
Are you talking to me
Are you speaking to me
I want to go to bed
You are not coming, are you
She doesn't close the door
I don't have anything to read
How do you make a box
I am shorter than you
You still have a lot to learn
I'm a little tired
I'm a bit tired
I want to be rich
Live and learn
No one is so old but he can learn
You live and learn
You live and learn
We live and learn
I'm not dead
Nobody came
Everybody likes him
Everyone loves him
That's what you think
I am shorter than you
The stakes are high
You must do as he says
I'll wait here
You're sick
Are you sick
Are you ill
I heard you crying
I don't know French
Your friend is correct
There’s not enough water
You still have a lot to learn
He didn't use to be like that
He wasn't like that in the past
Do you have anything to read
Read it to me
No one was alive
He rarely gives up
I'm very short
I think so
Where do I find that
He must be very happy
I know what she did
You don't know what you're doing
I really have to go
We do not have snow here
He drives fast
Do you know us
It'll soon be six o'clock
What is the cause of the fire
I totally don't believe you
I don't believe a word you say
She disliked him
She didn't like him
We were too late
We're too late
I like fish
The food wasn't that great
Are you tired
I'm the new teacher
What should I do now
I am in the soup
We've become quite fond of one another
She has many dogs
You're in Boston
You are in Boston
He said he would come
He looked at her angrily
I met him on the street
Does she speak English
She likes sleeping
Believe you me
You need this
I hate this job
He was very happy
He stood behind me
I am good at history
Don't make so much noise
He gets up at seven
A girl phoned me
Come tomorrow morning
The bike's mine
Can you see far
Who am I talking with
So be it
You're here early
Who goes there
Do you want anything to eat
I'm waiting for my mother
She heard him cry
I want a glass
I supposed him to be rich
Are you ten years old
I know a little French
It's my brother's
He's writing a book
We're getting tired
She fell asleep
You are rich
I'm beautiful
Don't talk like that
Don't you want to go
Please go to school
Those aren't mine
I like dogs very much
What does your son do
I am at home
I'm at home
Sit down with me
Sit with me
You're going to love this book
You're going to love this book
Will he be coming this evening
You can't leave yet
Do as he tells you
Do you know who they are
He reads a good deal
What are you cooking
I give up
My brother hates me
I will be back soon
I was at home
I think we have enough
He looked very happy
I was the only man
He doesn't have to know
I got up at six
I'll eat the apple
I like your car
Close the door, please
Will you please shut the door
Please shut the door
Close the door please
Please shut the door
I want to be rich
I'll take the bus
Talk to me
You are tired, aren't you
You look tired
I agree with him
She is already sleeping
She's already sleeping
I want to play
He is still in bed
I dislike being alone
We were all young once
We'll walk
I am shorter than you
He took a real liking to that house
It doesn't work like that
It doesn't work that way
She laughed at me
Everything has an end
How was your night
I'm in Boston
Do you want me to wait
You are a schoolteacher, aren't you
I did no such thing
I don't drink
We love each other
There was nobody here yesterday
The train is running fast
We should do this again
I've got a good idea
I didn't do it
He seldom, if ever, comes
She has a lot of friends here
How much money do you want
When did he arrive here
She hates herself
You've got my vote
You've got my vote
They're with me
I'm going to bed
Do you understand her
Is he studying now
He's studying
He's studying now
I don't have a problem with this
I have no problem with this
He wishes to become a doctor
I have a lot of books
He will be back soon
He'll be back soon
I took my shoes off
He was standing behind the door
Does that make you happy
We can't go back
We can't turn back
We cannot turn back
Can you see far
She loves her children
I really miss my wife
I heard you crying
I didn't see who was driving
I have something to tell you
How are you these days
She knows what you did
He likes it when I do that
I hope she is okay
Can I speak to her
What do you want to do tomorrow
We have nothing else
Are you going or not
We have a lot to do
We should go inside the house
Can you please be quiet
Are you ready to eat
I like that answer
That's just what he needs
He seems to be sick
It looks as if he were sick
He seems ill
I am going to be a doctor
Be quiet and listen to me
My wife doesn't cook
I have a dream
He was here at that time
The plan did not succeed
Do you know where I can find it
A little more
Nobody saw me
Is this where your mother works
She picked up her books
She will be ready
I suppose he'll come
I love reading books
What a beautiful night
I think he's going to be sick
This was all a mistake
I will give it to you
I don't speak English
Open the door, please
This sentence is mine
Open the door, please
Please open the door
You too, my son
I have an idea
I've got an idea
Give that to me
I love kids
I love coffee
I like this better than that
I suppose you like him
My father drives to work
How's your mother
He's sleeping like a baby
What do you really think
She's eating an apple
I love your hair
She has a picture
I'm too tired to do study
She wants children
You are beautiful
He raised his hand
This tastes like tea
He talked to himself
I never make my bed
I'm an old man
You look so beautiful
You're in Boston
You are in Boston
I'm dining out this evening
He got off the train
I know what you did
I know what you were doing
The house by the lake is mine
Good for you
I'd like to be a teacher
I have a family
I know these people
You know what I want
They say he is very rich
They say that he is very rich
They say he's very rich
Who the hell do you think you are
I know what he did
I have something to give you
You should go too
We're short on time
She has pretty eyes
Do you want a car
She made tea for me
I will be back soon
I'll be back right away
I'm not at all tired
I'm not a bit tired
She was the only woman
Does your friend like tea
We've got enough
They don't have to know
I was not a bit tired
May I talk to you
I am shorter than he
We'll be there at half past two
We'll be there at 2:30
He hates his life
She makes me happy
I have to work tomorrow
My cat loves milk
I don't know when
She opened the door
I have a lot of friends here
I have a lot of friends here
I think I'm ready
I'll miss you so much
How's your brother
He was the only man
I'm coming from home
Who's talking
It takes time
She understands him
Are you angry at him
I have to go home now
I am calling my brother
It will be ready soon
What a fine day it is
What a nice day it is
Both of you are right
The dog went away
When she comes, we'll eat
My parents are old
There was nobody
They're quiet
I'll be back in a jiffy
May they live long
Is the fish still alive
I think you're right
I think that you're right
Nobody knows where he lives
No one knows where he lives
How long were you there
He has had too many drinks
It seems she hates you
You're old enough now
What do you want now
Do you understand me
You are rich
I often read
I am working
I work
Don't you have school today
I was the only woman
Are you ready to eat
I don't have time now
We ought to leave now
He was at home
Been there, done that
I've been working
That's even better
She is working on the problem
How's your father
What do you want me to do
He always speaks well of her
Do you have a family
Come quickly
What more do you need
I can read them all
So, how did she like it
I'm waiting for my friend
I'm waiting for my boyfriend
When can I see you
Don't you have more to say
That could be a problem
No water, no life
I'm proud of you
We have a long way to go
Yesterday I was ill
He came to my rescue
I've had enough
Do you have anything further to say
I'll be back at ten
I'm playing with my cat
I play with my cat
You know something, don't you
I think you're ready
Give it back to me
Does that make you happy
This makes her angry
Do you have enough food
I answered the door
I see it rarely
Seldom do I see him
I seldom see him
I got sick
They are both good teachers
The child is writing a book
I'm younger than he is
I wrote this book
Day began to break
Who's coming
I have to see this movie
They're just evil
I have to go back
Everybody loves her
A man must work
Do you have a family
It was very difficult
Don't listen to her
This will be the best
He was too tired to study
She killed herself yesterday
I don't understand English
What do you want to do tomorrow
She stayed here by herself
What are you going to play
Don't listen to her
Are you still alone
How many friends do you have
What can you give me
He wants only the best
Do you have enough time
It was very hard
Do you think so
I am calm
How are you, son
I go to school
What does money mean to you
The cat likes sleeping
I don't have a family
I have no family
The woman is reading
I have three dogs
It was my idea
Are you busy
I have a new bicycle
He's been waiting here for a long time
I don't like her face
She wants me to help her
So, how did you like it
Do it by yourself
Do it yourself
You make me happy
It's starting now
I need to have a talk with you
I've got to speak to you
She seems rich
I'm going to take my car
He did it for the money
She doesn't have any friends
You are entirely correct
They never stopped
You should eat
You're cooperating
It's fun
That's fun
This is fun
Is that fun
I will give it to you
I relied on him
If you must, you must
Time is running out
Let's go out to eat
Who is standing there
Who listened
He likes tea
Yeah. I think so, too
Yes, I think so, too
I was at the party
What does he do for our town
You have many books
How fast she is running
Do you have a match
He has two dogs
Are you crazy, or what
Is that really true
Who'll go
I speak English a lot
My dogs are white
To the devil with you
How is everyone
How are you all
You have something on your face
What's wrong with it
He runs very fast
She knows the way
She will work
She will work
What kind of things do you enjoy doing
Yes, please
Do you need this book
Is this hat yours
You must work more
Will you make coffee for me
He hates himself
It sounds easy
It sounds simple
I knew it
I knew it
It seems she hates you
What can you give me
Life is fun
You must know yourself
I don't like to drive
He knows how to swim
She made a good speech
Does he speak English
He speaks English
He likes sleeping
We know him
What does your son do
He seems to be ill
He seems ill
Give me a little money
He read the book yesterday
Listen to this
You have something on your face
The door opened
This was your idea
It was your idea
You should eat
What do you want to do
Good for you
Are you getting tired
All will go except you
I can't think of anything
I'll call you up later
I will telephone you later on
I'll phone you later
I know where you dwell
That did me good
He laid himself on the bed
He dozed off
I sold a book
That dress looks good on you
This dress looks good on you
We're back home
What's the name of my doctor
He will be ready
Can I speak to him
I have to go to bed
May I have this book
I think it true
Never be this late again
He didn't say a word
He did not speak at all
It won't get anywhere
I am eating an apple
Are you still alone
I'll call him later
He's eating an apple
He is already sleeping
He's already sleeping
Are you having your period
You have beautiful eyes
Do you do that often
I'll be reading a book
I will read a book
What did she do to you
Better than nothing
I had some fun
I am ready
Do you actually like this
He asked after you
He went to bed
He will be back in a second
I'm going to read the book
We do not have any more bread
What a good idea
What a nice idea
You are the light of the world
Does anybody know him
He was sitting and reading a book
She is working night and day
She is working night and day
What would you like to eat
I like to study English
What do you want me to do
What should I do
You should go
One beer, please
Are we acquaintances
A beer, please
What are you thinking
I heard you crying
Please wait here for a while
I have no friends
I must be out of my mind
We are coming
We're coming
Don't close your eyes
It's raining there
My eyes are tired
I had a good idea
I got a good idea
I know what you are thinking
I know what they are thinking
I know what you're thinking
What do you want from me
We have two television sets
No one lives here anymore
Who the devil was that
She's rolling in money
She's loaded
She has ten children
He didn't say a word
I'm a fast learner
I'm a quick learner
Do you want another one of these
Much water is needed
It's raining again
It's raining again
It's raining again
Who said that
She made much use of milk in her cooking
How many people work here
They are my friends
Do you need much money
I love this song
I love this song
He got very mad
I feel well today
What am I doing here
Please repeat after me
How did you make it
How did you do it
He loves the son
What are you going to do
What will you do
How long has it been snowing
I'm to blame, not you
He did it for fun
It'll be too late then
So, how did he like it
You are only young once
Do you like your car
I owe her nothing
She laughed at me
Ken came up to me
The story ends well
Do you want to come with us
She felt a bit tired
I was just here yesterday
I'm to blame, not you
We need a car
We're not partners
When does it arrive
You should go
I think we have to go
His old cat is still alive
He didn't say a single word
It looks like rain
It looks as if it is going to rain
It is raining all the time
It won't stop raining
It may well be true
I sat down
I'm waiting for someone
I do that a lot
Do you want another one of these
Take anything you like
You know the drill
He was all alone in the house
He seems to be rich
Nobody tells me anything
I'm too old for this
It's getting cloudy
I don't mind if I do
Don't mind if I do
Sure, why not
He sat on the bed
You don't want to know
I am listening to a song
Don't you have any friends
We have water enough
We have enough water
Yes, we can go
She came last
I saw the doctor
It doesn't hurt
He hardly works
Almost all girls are kind
He should come right away
How do you spell it
It was a mistake
That was a mistake
I didn't like it
I already did that
Everybody loves him
Are you ready
Who owns this house
You are tired, aren't you
I don't care for him
He lives on this street
It was my husband's idea
He ran into the room
My wife cooks well
Coffee, please
He hung up
Do you know what they're called
I explained it to him
I have explained to him that
He wrote to me yesterday
She is very fond of flowers
Happy to see you
Are you going, too
Will you go, too
This hat doesn't fit me
I also want to know
Do you know what it's called
Whose car is that
Who is the owner of this car
I'll make some coffee
Don't you have any friends
He lost a book
He drives a car, doesn't he
Do you work here
I have to work
I need to work
You're late
I'm feeling sick
Nobody saw it coming
I want another beer
You explained that well
I can't say
I can't say that
Who the hell are you
I really want to know
I want a new dress
I owe you nothing
Do you know those people
He doesn't have any friends
Don't kid yourself
Don't deceive yourself
Come quickly
Come quickly
I don't want to hurt her
Nice to see you again
Wait for me
A cat has seven lives
I'm to blame, not you
Waiter, please bring me another glass of beer
All the dogs are alive
She knows where we live
We have enough time
How fast he runs
What do you want to do
You don't say
Let's cross the street
I met her late in the evening
I helped her into a gown
I miss you
How many people
What are these people doing
I can't speak German
I don't know German
I can't read
We're back early
I'm just kidding
I have a large family
I sat down next to her
She wants you dead
You explained that well
Nobody loves me
No one loves me
He knows the way
I bought a new car
I had an idea
I like your idea
Are you speaking to me
The room was full of people
I am studying English now
Those are our books
What the hell are you doing
I'm the best
What has he done to you
What has he done to you
What did he do to you
It must be hard for you
He bought a car
Do you like my friend
I am in the garden
What kind of a camera do you have
He ran away with the money
I don't want to hurt you
Do you want another one of these
Was he home alone
She broke my heart
You are children
Do you want him
If I could, I would
Do you know where we are
I'm not telling you
I'll see you later
Be kind to Mary
What is this called
What's it called
How does one call this
I won't let you escape
She has something in her hand
It's a matter of life and death
I love my son
Miss White is liked by everyone
Where are the boys
They are all dead
They're all dead
Shut the door
Close the door
I don't want anything to drink
What time do you want me to be here
I wanted to read a book
Her face was white
Don't you want to study
The child will be six
How heavy you are
Someone is coming
Someone's coming
Somebody's coming
Who's quitting
It was the cat's fault
You should do that soon
It was nothing but a joke
It was only a joke
Can't you speak French
That looked bad
Does it hurt a lot
Where is there a telephone
Do you want me to give you a hand
We have a new problem
I do not get up early
The child fell out of bed
Let him do it alone
Who stopped
Does that make you happy
She looks happy
She seems happy
Does this car belong to you?
I have to get home
I've got a plan
Everyone's dead
Do you want another one of these
That's a great start 
I am as tall as he
I'm as tall as he is
I'm the same height as he is
She won't be pleased
She won't like this
I want something to read
I would like something to read
It seems she hates you
I'm faster than you
We aren't friends
What exactly does that mean
I'm going downtown
He is walking very slowly
She sat next to me
They were sick
I'll know tomorrow
Will you have some more tea
All of us are happy
We're all happy
I can do it by myself
I can do it by myself
Where is the cat sleeping
They never give up
I wanted to talk with you
You can't read anymore
He has a large family
All of us went except for him
You should do that soon
She sat next to him on the bus
Say it
All the money was gone
Where were your parents
I love his son
They're already here
Don't stop him
Listen to this
I had fun with it
I almost never listen to the radio
I saw it happen
He wants me to help him
What did she do to you
I don't drink water
He has ten children
He's my age
You've already explained that
The baby did nothing but cry
Are you mad
Are you crazy
You are crazy
You're crazy
That smells good
He came home very late
He knows a lot of people
She loves children
She hardly speaks English
What was the weather like
I'm all alone here
Don't call me anymore
He scarcely said a word
He barely said a word
What else do I need to do
My joke went over very well
He called at my house
No one is going to harm you
How can I get to the police station
The train leaves at six
No one says that anymore
He wanted to be rich
Well, I must be going
I sat by his side
I sat next to him
I sat down next to him
Don't shut your eyes
She's going to be in charge
How's your mother
I think you're nice
He took off his shirt
I want the best
He delivered a speech
He was giving a speech
We're cooperating
Yes, my child
You're not going to like it
You can read this book
